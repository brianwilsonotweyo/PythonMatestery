# Using Min Max Sum for numbers in list

NumberList = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,10]
print (min(NumberList)) # this will give us the minimum number in the NumberList i.e 1
print (max(NumberList)) # this will give us the maximum number in the NumberList i.e 10
print (sum(NumberList)) # this will give us the total/ sum of all the individual numbers  in the NumberList i.e 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10 = 55 P.S this is the number of matatu i think😁
