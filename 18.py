# Sort() and Reverse() methods in Lists
animals = ['elephant', 'lion', 'tiger', "giraffe"]
# animals.sort() # if youre vigilant you noticed the list was sorted alphabetically 🥳🤩😏 output  ['elephant', 'giraffe', 'lion', 'tiger'] # to test this  commented out  the line below 
# animals.sort(reverse=True) #this sorts them but from Z-A test and see output is ['tiger', 'lion', 'giraffe', 'elephant']
animals.reverse() #this sorts the list from right to left not alphabetically output is ['giraffe', 'tiger', 'lion', 'elephant']

# remember to uncomment each line you'd want to test out. also they work separately so when one is uncommented the rest should be commented.

print(animals)
