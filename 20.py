# Using For loops in ListÃ«s
# the for loop can enable us print each element in the list, individually
animals = ['elephant', 'lion', 'tiger', "giraffe"]

for animal in animals:
    print(animal)# for each animal in the list animals, print animal this get each animal and prints it separately in an new line.ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Ž

# i guess we'll discuss more on indentation i.e that space you see after the :
print("thanks for using 20.py") #this will be printed only once because its outside of the identation thus not part of the loop.
